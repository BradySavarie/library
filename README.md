# Library Application

This library app helps users keep track of their books! Key information such as title, author, and read status is stored for each book that is added to the collection.

This application is part of The Odin Project's curriculum and the purpose of developing it is to get practice working with objects in javascript. It is also the first project that I design with a mobile first approach and make use of linting and formatting technologies (ESlint & Prettier) to help clean up my code.
