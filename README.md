<i>This application accepts key information about your books such as title, author, pages, and read status and stores it in your own personal library. Books can be added and removed from the library at any point, and the read status can be dynamically adjusted via the Read button.</i>

I developed this application as part of The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum with the goal of improving my ability to work with objects. I made it a priority to create a fully responsive design without using any media queries to set hard breakpoints, and this was the first project of mine that I took a mobile-first approach.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

Building this project gave me the opportunity to learn alot about modern CSS techniques such as mixing clamp functions with viewport units to achieve font-sizes that scale smoothly, using repeat functions with the auto-fit keyword and minmax limits to dynamically adjust the amount of columns in a grid system based on resolution, and styling more complicated components such as the Read Status checkbox that functions as an animated toggle switch.


It is the first project that I design with a mobile first approach and make use of linting and formatting technologies (ESlint & Prettier) to help clean up my code.
